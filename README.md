- 👋 Hi, I’m @DanielSasik
- 👀 I’m interested in math and robotics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about path generation for robotic arms.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that help me to learn program because my study program doesn't really allows me to program and learn programming as I would like.
- 📫 How to reach me message me
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have 3 swords and one is broken.
